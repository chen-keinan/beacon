    - name: 3.1.1 Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or
        more restrictive (Scored)
      description: |-
        If kube-proxy is running, and if it is using a file-based kubeconfig file, ensure that the proxy
        kubeconfig file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.
      profile_applicability: Master
      audit:
        - ps -ef | grep kube-proxy |grep 'kubeconfig' | grep -o 'kubeconfig=[^"]\S*' | awk -F "=" '{print $2}' |awk 'FNR <= 1'
        - stat -c %a #0
      remediation: Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
        node. For example,
        chmod 644 <proxy kubeconfig file>
      check_type: multi_param
      impact: External mechanisms for authentication generally require additional software to be
        deployed.
      eval_expr: "$1 <= 644;"
      default_value: See the GKE documentation for the default value.
      applicable: true
